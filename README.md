# Leaflet-Challenge

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. I visited the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and pick a data set to visualize. When you click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a visual representation of that data.

As a second step: 
I plotted a second data set on my map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. By pulling out a second data set I added a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out my 3 different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently. You can find different layers on the up right side of the map.
